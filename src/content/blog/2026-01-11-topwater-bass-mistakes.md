Topwater fishing is addictive — explosive strikes, heart-stopping misses, and stories that get better every retelling.

But many anglers sabotage themselves without realizing it.

## Mistake #1: Setting the Hook Too Fast

The most common error.
When a bass blows up, **wait**.
Let the fish turn with the bait before you swing.

Count “one-one-thousand” before setting the hook.

## Mistake #2: Fishing Topwater All Day

Topwater shines during:
- Low light
- Overcast conditions
- Calm mornings and evenings

Once the sun is high, consider switching unless fish are actively feeding.

## Mistake #3: Using the Wrong Line

Monofilament or braid is ideal.
Fluorocarbon sinks and kills topwater action.

## Mistake #4: Working the Bait Too Fast

Pauses trigger strikes.
Let the bait sit — especially around cover.

## Mistake #5: Ignoring Sound and Size

Match the hatch.
- Smaller bait for pressured water
- Louder baits for stained water

### Final Thought

Topwater bass fishing is about timing and restraint. Let the fish commit — then capitalize.
