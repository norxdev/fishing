Topwater fishing is addictive. Few things in fishing compare to watching a bass explode on a lure — but many anglers sabotage their success without realizing it.

Here are the most common mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Fishing Too Fast

The number one mistake is working the lure too aggressively. In many conditions, slower retrieves trigger more strikes.

Try:
- Longer pauses
- Subtle twitches
- Letting the bait sit after a missed strike

## Setting the Hook Too Soon

When a bass strikes on topwater, **wait until you feel the weight**. Setting the hook on the splash alone often pulls the lure away from the fish.

## Ignoring Low-Light Conditions

Topwater is most effective during:
- Early morning
- Late evening
- Overcast days

Many anglers give up too early once the sun rises.

## Final Advice

Topwater fishing is about patience and discipline. Slow down, wait on the hookset, and fish conditions — not the clock.
