Winter redfish fishing can be incredibly productive if you understand how fish behave in colder water.

## Focus on Warmer Water
Redfish stack up in shallow flats that warm quickly during the day.

## Slow Your Presentation
Cold water slows metabolism. Soft plastics worked slowly outperform fast-moving lures.

## Best Winter Lures
- Paddle tail soft plastics  
- Gold spoons on sunny days  
- Scented baits  

Winter rewards patience.
