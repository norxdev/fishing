Winter redfish fishing can be extremely productive — **if you adjust your approach**. Many anglers struggle during colder months because they fish the same areas and lures they use in summer.

This guide breaks down **where redfish go in winter**, how their behavior changes, and the tactics that reliably put fish in the boat.

## Where Redfish Go in Winter

As water temperatures drop, redfish seek **stable conditions**. They favor:

- Deep creek bends
- Channel edges
- Docks with darker bottoms
- Mud flats near deeper water

Mud retains heat, often making it several degrees warmer than surrounding sand.

## How Their Feeding Changes

Redfish become less willing to chase fast-moving lures. Instead, they focus on:

- Slow presentations
- Easy meals
- Bottom-oriented forage

That means lure speed matters more than lure choice.

## Best Winter Lures

Some of the most consistent winter producers include:

- Soft plastic paddletails on light jig heads
- Gold spoons worked slowly near bottom
- Shrimp imitations with subtle movement

Let your lure sit longer than feels comfortable — most winter bites happen on the pause.

## Final Thoughts

Winter redfish are predictable once you understand their environment. Slow down, target deeper water, and fish methodically. The reward is often **less pressure and bigger fish**.
