Winter can be challenging for redfish anglers, but with the right tactics, you can still consistently catch fish. Here’s a detailed guide to **finding and catching redfish in the colder months**.

## 1. Focus on Shallow Flats

In winter, redfish tend to school in shallow flats where water warms slightly faster. Look for areas with slight depth changes, oyster beds, or creek channels.

**Tip:** Use a chart or local maps to identify flats near tidal creeks — fish often congregate there when the temperature drops.

## 2. Adjust Your Lure Selection

Redfish are less active in winter, so they often ignore fast-moving baits. Use **slow-moving soft plastics or spoons** that mimic sluggish prey.

**Tip:** Try paddletail plastics or jigs in natural colors like brown, olive, or gray to match winter forage.

## 3. Time Your Fishing Around Tides

Tides have a huge impact on redfish behavior. In winter, redfish feed more actively during **rising tides** when they move into flats to hunt.

**Tip:** Check tide charts and plan your trips around the incoming tide for the best chance of strikes.

## 4. Pay Attention to Water Temperature

Redfish are cold-blooded and slow down as temperatures drop. Water temperature directly affects activity and strike rates.

**Tip:** Target areas that warm faster, like shallow, sunlit flats. Slow your retrieve to compensate for colder water.

**Conclusion:**  
Winter redfish fishing rewards preparation and patience. By focusing on shallow flats, matching lure speed to water temperature, and using tides to your advantage, you can land winter redfish even when the bite slows.
