Winter redfishing can be frustrating if you fish it like summer. Cold water slows everything down — baitfish, redfish, and your margin for error.

The key is **location, timing, and patience**.

## Focus on Warmth, Not Depth

Redfish don’t disappear in winter, but they *relocate*. Look for:
- Shallow flats that warm quickly in the sun
- Dark mud bottoms that retain heat
- Areas protected from north winds

Midday, not morning, is usually your best window.

## Slow Down Your Presentation

Cold water means slower metabolism. Fast retrieves turn fish off.

Effective winter baits:
- Soft plastics on light jig heads
- Gold spoons worked slowly
- Paddle tails bounced gently along the bottom

If you think you’re moving too slow, slow down more.

## Tides Matter More Than Ever

Moving water creates opportunity.
- Incoming tides push warmer water onto flats
- Outgoing tides concentrate bait in drains

Fish the **edges**, not the middle.

### Final Thought

Winter redfish reward anglers who fish deliberately. Cover less water, fish smarter, and trust the process.
