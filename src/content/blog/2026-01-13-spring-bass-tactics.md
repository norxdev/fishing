Spring is bass season — but it’s also the most misunderstood.

Bass behavior shifts quickly, and anglers who don’t adapt fall behind fast.

## Pre-Spawn: Follow the Migration

Bass move shallow in stages.
Target:
- Secondary points
- Channel swings
- Transition banks

Reaction baits excel during this phase.

## Spawn: Precision Matters

During the spawn:
- Bass hold tight to beds
- Subtle presentations win
- Soft plastics shine

Avoid burning down the bank — fish methodically.

## Post-Spawn: Think Recovery

Post-spawn bass are hungry but tired.
Look for:
- Shallow cover
- First drop-offs
- Nearby feeding flats

Topwater and swim jigs are deadly here.

### Final Thought

Spring success comes from recognizing *which phase you’re fishing*, not forcing a single pattern all season.
