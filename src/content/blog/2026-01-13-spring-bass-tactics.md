Spring is one of the most exciting times to fish for bass, but it’s also one of the easiest seasons to fish **incorrectly**.

As water warms, bass move shallow — but not randomly. Understanding their movement patterns is the key to success.

## Understanding the Pre-Spawn

Before bass move onto beds, they stage in:

- Secondary points
- Channel swings
- Shallow flats near deeper water

These areas allow bass to feed aggressively while staying close to safety.

## Best Lures for Early Spring

During this phase, reaction baits shine:

- Lipless crankbaits
- Spinnerbaits
- Suspending jerkbaits

Focus on covering water until you locate fish, then slow down.

## Water Temperature Matters

Pay close attention to water temperature trends, not just the number:

- Rising temps = aggressive fish
- Sudden cold fronts = pull back to deeper staging areas

## Key Takeaway

Spring bass fishing rewards anglers who adapt daily. Let water temperature, clarity, and weather dictate your approach rather than forcing a single pattern.
