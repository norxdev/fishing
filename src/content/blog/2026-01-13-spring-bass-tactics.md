Spring is one of the best times of the year to target bass. As the water warms, bass move into shallow areas preparing to spawn. Here are **proven spring bass tactics** to increase your catch rates.

## 1. Target Shallow Areas Early

Early mornings in shallow coves or near submerged vegetation are prime spots. Bass will feed aggressively after cold winter months.

**Tip:** Scout areas with shallow cover such as lily pads, fallen trees, or brush piles — bass often stage here before moving to spawning beds.

## 2. Use Lighter, Finesse Lures

During spring, bass can be cautious. Finesse lures like **soft plastics, small crankbaits, or spinnerbaits** work well for natural presentations.

**Tip:** A 1/8 oz jig or a small craw imitation can entice bites that heavier lures may not provoke.

## 3. Pay Attention to Water Temperature

Bass become more active as water reaches 55–70°F. Knowing the temperature of the water can help you **predict where bass will be feeding**.

**Tip:** Use a thermometer or a fish finder with temperature reading to identify “hot spots” in the lake or river.

## 4. Vary Your Presentation

Bass can get conditioned to repeated patterns. Mix retrieves, pauses, and lure types to keep bass interested.

**Tip:** Alternate between a slow, steady retrieve and a short twitch-retrieve to mimic natural prey.

**Conclusion:**  
Spring bass fishing combines timing, location, and technique. Target shallow water early, use finesse lures, watch water temperatures, and vary your presentation — you’ll catch more bass and enjoy the thrill of spring fishing!
